                <h3 id="intro-title">Introduction</h3>
                <p>At gold belt, we introduce form into their curriculum. Form is a set of moves in a row that tell the
                    story of a fight. The beginning forms are some boring fights, but as they progress through the
                    ranks, the forms get better. We teach traditional taekwondo forms eventually as well as creative and
                    extreme forms (imagine Hollywood fight scenes). Forms help the students with coupling the
                    memorization of the moves to motions with their body, exercising multiple muscle sets, thinking and
                    moving simultaneously, performing by themselves, and more. I could talk about form all day.

                <p>At this rank, the students only need their uniform. The uniform must be a National Karate uniform.
                    During the summer, students may wear a National Karate t-shirt tucked into their pants accompanied
                    by their belt instead of the full uniform. At gold belt with a green stripe (aka green
                    stripe), I would recommend talking to Mr. Boone about purchasing sparring equipment which they will
                    start using at solid green belt.</p>

                <h3 id="tape-stripes-title">The way tape stripes work</h3>
                <p>The electrical tape that we use on the students' belts is for keeping track of their skill as well as
                    their attendance. Every 4(ish) classes, we take a look at the students in class to see how they're
                    doing in regards to the karate moves and as well as their listening skills. Depending on that, we
                    award them with a tape. When they earn all three tapes, they are pretty close to testing for their
                    next belt.</p>

            <!-- Tournament Info -->
            <article class="section" id="tournament" aria-labelledby="tournament-title">
                <h3 id="tournament-title">Tournaments</h3>
                <p>We do offer tournaments at this level to the students. Just like there are four rings in the main
                    classroom, there are a bunch of rings at the tournaments. The student's assigned ring will be with
                    other students their age and belt level. They can't compete in every division since
                    they can't backflip (yet), but they can participate in the following divisions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Performance Basics</strong> is where they get called up one at a time to do the basic
                        karate moves that we do in class. Many time before a tournament, all we do is practice these
                        moves in order to get them ready for the tournaments. In this division, it's like a
                        participation division where everyone gets a trophy. In my opinion, this is a great division for
                        new competitors and it should also be paired with the competitive basics division, so the
                        students compete in both divisions. Additionally, it's been a while since your student has done
                        a tournament, you can treat this division as the warm up for the competitive division.</li>
                    <li><strong>Competitive Basics</strong> is where they get called up one at a time to do the basic
                        moves, but this times it's graded and compared to the rest of the students. Here's what the
                        judges grade on: </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Correct Technique (i.e. twist on a punch)</li>
                        <li>Speed (move as fast as you can on every single motion)</li>
                        <li>Power (hit hard)</li>
                        <li>Loud Yells (yell loudly and no screaming)</li>
                        <li>Intense/Focused Face (intense face and look at your target instead of around the room)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Performance Form</strong> is where they get called up one at a time to present their
                        form. We frequently practice the routine in classes leading up to tournaments. In this division,
                        it's like a participation division where everyone gets a trophy. In my opinion, this is a great
                        division for new competitors and it should also be paired with the competitive form division,
                        so the students compete in both divisions. Additionally, if it has been a while since your
                        student has done a tournament, you can treat this division as the warm up for the competitive
                        division.</li>
                    <li><strong>Competitive Form</strong> is where they get called up one at a time to their form, but
                        this time it's graded and compared to the rest of the students. Here's what the
                        judges grade on: </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Correct Technique (i.e. correct and deep stances)</li>
                        <li>Speed (move as fast as you can on every single motion)</li>
                        <li>Power (hit hard)</li>
                        <li>Loud Yells (yell loudly and no screaming)</li>
                        <li>Intense/Focused Face (intense face and look at your target instead of around the room)</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>The next belt is green belt. At green belt, students start the sparring class. They will need a set
                    of sparring equipment at this rank, so please talk to Mr. Boone while they are still a gold belt
                    with a green stripe.</p>
