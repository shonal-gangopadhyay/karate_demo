                <p>Hi, I'm Shonal Gangopadhyay, but you can call me Mr. G. This is not an official National Karate
                    website! This is for me to share with my students' parents without having to print anything out ðŸ˜‰
                    This site gives parents a clear, schoolâ€‘specific roadmap so every student knows what to practice,
                    what to expect at each belt, and how to be ready for success.</p>

            <div class="info">
                <h3>High level roadmap</h3>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><strong>New students</strong> start on an introductory program before starting their martial
                        arts journey. Generally, they will learn basics, slow kicks, fast kicks, paper kicks, pad
                        strikes, marching basics, forms, self-defense, and eventually weapons and sparring. In addition
                        to learning physical skills, they will also learn life skills such as respect, focus, and
                        discipline.</li>
                    <li><strong>White belts</strong> and <strong>Gold belts</strong> are usually in the same class. They
                        focus on basics, respect, discipline, and focus.</li>
                    <li><strong>Green belts</strong> start sparring classes and continue form classes. Sparring classes
                        are denoted by an asterisk
                        (*) on your school's schedule. Students must purchase a sparring equipment package from their
                        school's director/instructor. Students must attend at least one regular class and one sparring
                        class per week. I would recommend two of each per week if you can, we don't charge extra.</li>
                    <li><strong>Purple belts</strong> continue form and sparring classes. This is when my students
                        usually really take off since they've been a student for almost a year now.</li>
                    <li><strong>Blue belts</strong> at most schools start training with the bo staff during their form
                        class. Bo staves must be purchased from your school's director/instructor. Training with a
                        weapon teaches the students how to treat the bo as an extension to their body.</li>
                    <li><strong>Red belts</strong> start training for black belt. They are now an advanced belt, so this
                        is the start of perfecting everything that they have learned so far. They will learn a few new
                        things such as a new form, Zang Do Moon, but they learned most of our basics already at this
                        point.</li>
                    <li><strong>Brown belts</strong> will learn a new bo form, Discovery, and some schools teach a
                        musical form, Beethoven. Brown belt is really just months of training for Black Belt.</li>
                    <li><strong>First Degree Black belts</strong> are masters of the basics. This is where the
                        curriculum expands immensely. Sparring competition is different, form has new weapons, they can
                        create their own forms, self-defense has more concepts and defenses, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Second Degree Black belts</strong> are straight up impressive martial artists. I make my
                        2nd degrees teach as well which comes with a huge list of skills that they pick up.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third Degree Black belts</strong> are good.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="info">
                <h3>Quick notes</h3>
                <p>Here are a few things that I want to get out there. Please ask me or your instructor if you have any
                    questions on any of these points. These are all things we offer that I maybe didn't cover above.</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Sparring equipment must be purchased from your NK school.</li>
                    <li>Bo staves (blue belt), kamas (black belt) and bokkens (black belt) must be purchased from your
                        NK school.</li>
                    <li>Mr G's opinion: Students should bring <strong>all</strong> of their equipment to every class.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cleaning your sparring equipment is mandatory.</li>
                    <li>A bo staff is a weapon so handle it with care and respect.</li>
                    <li>I never let siblings spar. There's too much that can go wrong.</li>
                    <li>During the school year, students must wear their full uniform to form classes. For summer
                        classes and all sparring classes, students can either wear their full uniform or they can wear
                        their karate pants, their belt, and a NK tshirt tucked into their pants. Some schools make it
                        mandatory to wear the tshirt from that year.</li>
                    <li>Different schools have slightly different rules when it comes to upgrading from the white
                        uniform to the white and black uniform with their name on the back. Talk to your directory to
                        see how your school operates. There's also a blue uniform with red trim and a white uniform with
                        red trim that you can ask about.</li>

                <h3>Tournaments</h3>
                <p>All NK students have the option of attending I think 7 tournaments that are locally run
                    throughout the tournament season. Anyone who is a blue belt or higher has probably already heard
                    about the NK intramural/NK team tournament and/or Diamond Nationals.</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Just like there are ring(s) in the classroom, there will be a bunch of rings at the tournament.
                    </li>
                    <li>Each ring will only have students of a certain age, gender, and belt rank.</li>
                    <li>We'll tell you which ring and at what time to go to your ring.</li>
                    <li>Students have a wide array of options that they can compete or participate in. Talk to your
                        instructor to see which of these divisions is a good fit for your student. Also, not every
                        tournament offers every single division. I usually recommend competing in competitive form,
                        competitive weapons, and sparring if the student is a high enough belt for all those divisions.
                    </li>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li><strong>Performance Basics</strong> is where your student and their fellow competitors get
                            called up one at a time to the center of the ring. The center judge will read off all their
                            moves that they practice in class and the student just has to do them (well). The students
                            <strong>do not</strong> receive a grade/score for performance divisions.

                        <li><strong>Performance Form</strong> is where your student and their fellow competitors get
                            called up one at a time to present their form. I recommend this for anyone who has never
                            competed before (usually white, gold, and green belts.) The students
                            <strong>do not</strong> receive a grade/score for performance divisions.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Competitive Form</strong> is where your student and their fellow competitors get
                            called up one at a time to present their form. They absolutely do get scored on their
                            performance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Competitive Weapons</strong> is just like form, but it's with weapons. This is Mrs.
                            G's favorite competition.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sparring</strong> divisions are split into a bracket where students must win in
                            order to move on in the bracket.</li>
                        <li><strong>CMX</strong> stands for creative, musical, and extreme which is usually just for
                            black belts. Some schools have their students start musical at brown belt.</li>

                <h3>How the rest of the site is organized</h3>
                <p>Pick your school, then jump directly to any belt. Every belt page follows the same structure:
                    <em>What classes focus on</em>, <em>New concepts</em>, <em>Expectations</em>, <em>Resources
                        (videos)</em>, and <em>Testing requirements</em>. Right now, only Maple Grove's site is being
                    worked on.
